# PicoGK Documention

PicoGK uses the C# programming language to build complex computational geometry. Written by [Lin Kayser](https://github.com/linkayser) and maintained by [LEAP 71](https://leap71), it forms the basis of a comprehensive framework for Computational Engineering, a new discipline which transcribes engineering knowledge into algorithmic building blocks that can autonomously design entire machines.

## Getting started

To work with PicoGK, you will need to write computer code in C#. 

If you are new to this, [read the detailed steps here on how to set up your work environment](setup.md).

If you are an expert, this is what you need to do to run your first PicoGK project:

- Create a new C# console project
- Add the PicoGK Nuget package
- Call `Library.Go` from `Program.cs` to launch the viewer and execute the task you specify

You can clone or download the [PicoGK_Examples repository](https://github.com/leap71/PicoGK_Examples) to have a ready-made project template with example code.

## Resources

- The [PicoGK_Examples](https://github.com/leap71/PicoGK_Examples) repo showcases various things you can do with PicoGK
- Join in on the conversation at [PicoGK discussions on GitHub](https://github.com/leap71/PicoGK/discussions) 
- [Coding for Engineers is an open-access book project](https://picogk.org/coding-for-engineers/) written by Lin Kayser, which aims at teaching engineers the basics of programming.
- The [LEAP 71 GitHubhttps://github.com/leap71](https://github.com/josefinelissner) has various public projects, including the Shape Kernel, Lattice Library and other repos written by [Josefine Lissner](https://github.com/josefinelissner), which extend PicoGK beyond it's basic functionality.
